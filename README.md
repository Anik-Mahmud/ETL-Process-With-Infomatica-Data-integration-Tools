# ETL-Process-With-Infomatica-Data-integration-Tools
Hello everyone!
Firstly, I installed  Informatica data integration tools. Then I go to the administration part. I create a repository and powercenter integration service. Then I configure this with my local database.
Informatica has 4 parts.
1.Informatica Powercenter Manager.(2)Power Center Designer.(3)Workflow Manager.(4)Workflow Monitor
1.Powercenter manager: With this tool, we configure  Powercenter integration Service and create folders.
2.Power Center Designer:This is the main tools of informatica.We connect and create source and target (file/db/folder)with this tool. Then we design our mapping in this tool.
3.Workflow Manager:When we finished our mapping, then we come to the workflow manager.Here we create a Workflow and session for that mapping.the we configure the session.We schedule workflow in this tool.
4.Workflow Monitor:When we create our workflow then we run it.When we run it,we monitor the workflow with this tool.How many data inserts, how many rejected,how we get an error, all things we can see with this tool.

Now,you can see my process .I think you understand.

Thank you.
